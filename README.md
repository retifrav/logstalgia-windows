## Archived

The repository has been archived, as it made more sense to have it as a [vcpkg port](https://github.com/retifrav/vcpkg-registry/tree/master/ports/logstalgia) rather than a full-blown fork.

If anything, pre-built packages will likely be published [here](https://files.decovar.dev/public/packages/logstalgia/).

## About

[Logstalgia](https://logstalgia.io/) - a web-server access log visualization tool.

This repository is a fork of the [original repository](https://github.com/acaudwell/Logstalgia). I am not the author and I did not participate in the development.

The purpose of this repository is to provide pre-built binaries for Windows - you can find those under releases. More information in the [following article](https://decovar.dev/blog/2019/08/17/logstalgia-windows-build/).
